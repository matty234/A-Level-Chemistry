  <= 0 - Reaction feasible
  >  0 - Reaction not feasible
  ΔG = ΔH-TΔS

Period 3
  P3 Ionic Oxides (Mg, Na) are Alkaline
  P3 Ionic Oxides (P, S) are Acidic
    P4O10 → H3PO4
    SO2   → H2SO3
    SO3   → H2SO4
  Oxides Formed: Na2O, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, P4O10, SO2
  Reactions in air:
    Na, Mg - Vigorous
    Al, Si - Slow
  Flames:
    Na - Yellow
    Mg - White
    P  - White
    S  - Blue
  Boiling/Melting Points:
    Ionic (MgO, Na2O, Al2O3) - High (because ionic lattices, many bonds)
      MgO Stronger than Na2O because Mg donates 2 electrons
    Giant Macromolecular (SiO2) - Medium
    Simple Molecular (P4O10, SO2) - Low (only weak intermolecular forces)

Electrochemical Series
  More negative - better at oxidation / reducing agents, on left of equation
  More positive - better at reduction / oxidizing agent, on right of equation

Non Rechargeable Batteries
  Advantages:
    Cheaper
  Disadvantages:
    More resources used to produce
    More waste produced

Transition Metals
  Characteristics:
    Partially filled D subshell
    High density
    High melting, boiling points
    Good catalysts - e.g. Haber process
    Variable oxidation states
    Form coloured ions
  Complex ions (ligands): - with COORDINATE bonds
    6 bonds - Octahedral
    4 bonds - Tetrahedral
    2 bonds - Linear
  One ligand can form multiple bonds:
    1 bond  - Unidentate
    2 bonds - Bidentate
    * bonds - Multidentate

Catalysts
  States
    Same state      - Homogenous
    Different State - Heterogeneous (e.g. Contact process see below)
  Autocatalysis   - Reaction product acts as a catalyst for the reaction

Lewis
  Lewis acid - accepts electron pair
  Lewis base - donates electron pair

Metal Aqua Ions
  Always Acidic
  Adding OH ions produces insoluble hydroxide ions
    (same for NH3, CO3 ions)

Ligand Substition
  Positive entropy - greater stability
  Can be partial
  Different sizes - different coordination number


Contact Process
  Oxidation of SO2 into SO3 by V5+:
    2SO2 + 4V5+ + 2O2− → 2SO3 + 4V4+
  Oxidation of V4+ back into V5+ by oxygen (catalyst regeneration):
    4V4+ + O2 → 4V5+ + 2O2−

Haber Process
  Iron catalyst
  N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3
