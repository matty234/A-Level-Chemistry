The Perfect Ionic Model
  100% ionic bondings
  perfect spherical ions

Factors effecting entropy
  Physical State
  Dissolving
  More Particles

Gibbs Free Energy
  <= 0 , Reaction feasible
  >  0 , Reaction not feasible

Period 3 Oxides
  Ionic Oxides (Mg, Na) are Alkaline
  Ionic Oxides (P, S) are Acidic

Electrochemical Series
  More negative - better at undergoing oxidation / reducing agents
  More positive - better at undergoing reduction / oxidizing agent
  
Non-Rechargeable Batteries
  Advantages
    Cheaper
  Disadvantages
    More resources used to produce
    More waste produced
