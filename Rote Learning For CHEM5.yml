The Perfect Ionic Model
  100% ionic bondings
  perfect spherical ions

Factors effecting entropy
  Physical State
  Dissolving
  More Particles

Gibbs Free Energy
  <= 0 - Reaction feasible
  >  0 - Reaction not feasible

Period 3
  Ionic Oxides (Mg, Na) are Alkaline
  Ionic Oxides (P, S) are Acidic
    P4O10 -> H3PO4
    SO2   -> H2SO3
    SO3   -> H2SO4
  Oxides Formed: Na2O, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, P4O10, SO2
  Reactions in air:
    Na, Mg - Vigorous
    Al, Si - Slow
  Flames:
    Na - Yellow
    Mg - White
    P  - White
    S  - Blue
  Boiling/Melting Points:
    Ionic (MgO, Na2O, Al2O3) - High (because ionic lattices, many bonds)
      MgO Stronger than Na2O because Mg donates 2 electrons
    Giant Macromolecular (SiO2) - Medium
    Simple Molecular (P4O10, SO2) - Low (only weak intermolecular forces)

Electrochemical Series
  More negative - better at oxidation / reducing agents, on left of equation
  More positive - better at reduction / oxidizing agent, on right of equation

Non Rechargeable Batteries
  Advantages
    Cheaper
  Disadvantages
    More resources used to produce
    More waste produced

Transition Metals
  Partially filled D subshell
  High density
  High melting, boiling points
  Good catalysts - Haber process
  Variable oxidation states
  Form coloured ions
  Complex ions (ligands) - with COORDINATE bonds
    6 bonds - Octahedral
    4 bonds - Tetrahedral
    2 bonds - Linear
  One ligand can form multiple bonds
    1 bond  - Unidentate
    2 bonds - Bidentate
    * bonds - Multidentate
