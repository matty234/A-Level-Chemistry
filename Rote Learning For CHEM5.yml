The Perfect Ionic Model
  100% ionic bondings
  perfect spherical ions

Factors effecting entropy
  Physical State
  Dissolving
  More Particles

Gibbs Free Energy
  <= 0 - Reaction feasible
  >  0 - Reaction not feasible

Period 3
  Ionic Oxides (Mg, Na) are Alkaline
  Ionic Oxides (P, S) are Acidic
  Oxides Formed: Na2O, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, P4O10, SO2
  Reactions in air:
    Na, Mg - Vigorous
    Al, Si - Slow
  Flames:
    Na - Yellow
    Mg - White
    P  - White
    S  - Blue
  Boiling/Melting Points:
    Ionic (MgO, Na2O, Al2O3) - High (because ionic lattices, many bonds)
      MgO Stronger than Na2O because Mg donates 2 electrons
    Giant Macromolecular (SiO2) - Medium
    Simple Molecular (P4O10, SO2) - Low (only weak intermolecular forces)

Electrochemical Series
  More negative - better at undergoing oxidation / reducing agents
  More positive - better at undergoing reduction / oxidizing agent

Non Rechargeable Batteries
  Advantages
    Cheaper
  Disadvantages
    More resources used to produce
    More waste produced

Transition Metals
  Partially filled D sub-shell
